        I believe that I would be an exccellent candidate in working as a Front-End developer Intern.
        <br><br>
        My previous employers have commended me for being a quick learner and an great communicator.
        In addition, I make it a priority to familiriaze myself with the platform, as well as the team,
        that I am working with.
        <br><br>
        From talking to various recruiters at networking events, to hearing about
        the company culture, and work ethic from interns and full-time employees,
        there are many things that make me want to work for Shopify. I am also
        excited to learn and contribute to the Shopify e-commerce ecosystem!
        <br><br><br>
        Lastly, Thank you for taking the time to read this!
        <br><br>
        Please feel free to contact me via phone or email at your earliest convinience.
        I hope to hear back from you.
        <br><br>
        Thanks and with Best Regards,
        <br>
