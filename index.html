        Hi Darlene from Shopify!
        <br><br>
        I am applying for the Shopify Developer Intern position for the
        Summer 2017 term as a Front-End Developer Intern.
        <br><br>
        I heard about this position from one of the current co-op
        students at Shopify, Ismail Syed.
        <br><br>
        I believe that I would be a good candidate for this position
        because I have:
        <br><br>
        <tab>
          • Experience in developing client-driven projects for in the industry
          <br><br>
          • Technical skills in developing web applications
          <br><br>
          • Interest and passion in learning different technologies with
          individual and group projects
          <br><br>
          • Enthusiasm in sharing my experience and technical expertise to others
          and encouraging others to do the same.
        </tab>
        <br><br>
        I am currently studying Computer Systems Engineering at Carleton
        University. From the practical knowledge I gained in Object Oriented Programming,
        and building real-time IoT systems, I was able to create a few projects
        both by myself and with other students.
        <br><br>
        During my work terms, I developed features and fixed bugs on
        applications using AngularJS, MongoDB, and Node.js
        <br><br>
        I also have a passion towards communicating and sharing my experiences
        and knowledge about my skills to other students. I have helped organize
        professional networking events, and technical workshops within the
        Ottawa region through the IEEE Carleton University Student Branch.
        <br><br>
        I also led the Makerspace run by IEEE Carleton in 2016 called Stay Late
        and Make. Along with a few other students, some of whom currently and
        previously worked at Shopify, we provided a hardware library, introductory
        workshops for both software and hardware technologies, and guidance for any
        students that walked into our room. This also demonstrates communication and
        leadership skills I have to collaborate with others to a common goal.
        <br><br>
        From talking to various recruiters at networking events, to hearing about
        the company culture, and work ethic from interns and full-time employees,
        there are many things that make me want to work for Shopify. I am also
        excited to learn and contribute to the Shopify e-commerce ecosystem!
        <br><br><br>
        Lastly, Thank you for taking the time to read this! I hope to hear back from you.
        <br><br>
        You can contact me by email and by phone that's on my resume.
        <br><br>
        Thanks and with Best Regards,
        Irusha Vidanamadura
